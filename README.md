# Markkët Client

## NextJS application compatible with Markkët API

Front end client for a Markkëtplace stores & managers

### Manage storefronts

New & existing users can manage their accounts, and store content

### Multi user & stores

Individual store fronts can use static site templates to read all the data during build time [markketplace-astro](https://github.com/calimania/markketplace-astro)

This client combines server & browser isomorphic javascript to interact with our decentralized markket instances

Server operations are performed with keys generated secretly for broad operations

Users perform operations in the browser with their granted credentials

### Self hosting

Create an account in our instance, or deploy in your infrastructure for more control & customization

### Open source ecosystem

The markkët API is powered by Strapi, Postgres, Docker & Redis

This client uses typescript, react, tailwind, mantine, tabler & is open to community contributions

### NextJS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
